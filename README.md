# netty

mock netty from kkb

first,we shoud prepare a server to listen other client's request.And in this case,we need one module which named api . 
This module is used to link server and client to ensure they could tell each other's message.
we know restful base on http protocol to deal with machine's communication.And osi's module,http on top of tcp/udp,so netty 
have more effective. as thrift ,we know it provide many language ,not only java. netty base java to code.
